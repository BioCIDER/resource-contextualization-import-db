DB Abstraction Layer

> Python classes to manage different DBs, their connections and functionality. 

## Getting Started

You need a proper python interpreter for your system. Download it from [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Version tested with this application is 2.7.

Also, you need to download pysolr library to operate with SolR DB.
You can download it from:
[Pysolr downloads](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysolr)

Last version tested is 3.3.2.


## Abstraction layer

In order to avoid depending excessively on one specific DB implementation, we have built some classes to isolate it the rest of the code.

### DBFactory

This class should be the entry point for anyone who wants to use our persistence system.

### AbstractManager

Abstract class that should be implemented by all specific DB manager classes. 
One user of this abstraction layer only should care about methods in this class to manage data, without any knowledge about which specific DB manager is underlying.

One of those classes is our SolrManager class into /solr folder.

## SolR installation


To configure SolR properly, you will need to put into your server folder some files provided in this repository.

From solr\schema folder:

* managed-schema.xml

From solr\config folder:

* solrconfig.xml 
* synonyms.txt 
* stopwords.txt 

Also, you will need to modify this file:

> [solr-folder]/server/etc/webdefault.xml

Introducing next code at the end in order to enable SolR to manage CORS requests:

 ```
 
<filter>
  <filter-name>cross-origin</filter-name>
  <filter-class>org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CrossOriginFilter</filter-class>
  <init-param>
    <param-name>allowedOrigins</param-name>
    <param-value>*</param-value>
  </init-param>
  <init-param>
    <param-name>allowedMethods</param-name>
    <param-value>GET,POST,OPTIONS,DELETE,PUT,HEAD</param-value>
  </init-param>
  <init-param>
    <param-name>allowedHeaders</param-name>
    <param-value>origin, content-type, accept</param-value>
  </init-param>
</filter>

  <filter-mapping>
  <filter-name>cross-origin</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
</web-app>

```
